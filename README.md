# Simple Todo App

This is a simple todo list in which I have learning refactoring code into OOP format. I started with code in index.js and validate.js that I implemented into Todo.js and FormValidator.js applying OOP principles. This was my first time using OOP in a project and working with modular JavaScript. This reminds me of my first time separating my index.css files into individual blocks according to BEM file structure.

## Functionality

With this todo app, you can add todo items (must use at least 2 characters due to the form validation) and optionally set a due date for each todo item. You can then check, uncheck, or delete todo items.

## Technology

- JavaScript
- Modular JavaScript (using import and export statements)
- Utilization of OOP (encapsulation with private and public methods, inheritance, polymorphism)

## Deployment
